# LAN Enumerator Hints : 
- Kindly  check default ports for (MYSQL / MSSQL / ORCALE / etc. ) Databases (search about it)
- Check also default ports
- Check Shared Folders Ports 
- Check Firewalls names 
- Get Host name from local ip on LAN , and check if that is tree from the forest or not 
- most of organizations uses word "mail" to mail there mail servers 
- Check the WSUS ip address [there is a tinty log file in victim pc you will find for WSUS update and inside it you will find its ip] 🤣 (if you got this , you can insert a trojan patch in update , all the network computers will catch that trojan as an update patch 🤣🤣🤣 )
- Check the SCCM ip address (if you got this , you can install a pre-infected ".wim" whole windows image allover network computers 🤣)
- Check the DC servers ip address (domain controller) (if you got that you can elevate any user groups into network admins)
- all of above also , you can check "VSHPERE" computers which are carrying all of that , and can also check it`s exploits and can add them into victim pc and execute them to infect the whole Vmware ESXI 🤣 
- and after all of that , there is more and more and more , Stay Tuned 😉😉
